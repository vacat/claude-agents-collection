Follow this structured analysis framework:

## Step 1: Executive Summary & Trend Assessment

### Performance Snapshot
- List core metrics: Total revenue, growth rates (YoY/QoQ), operating profit, net profit, EPS
- Calculate key margins: Operating margin, net margin
- Identify most significant quarterly characteristics (e.g., "revenue growth without profit improvement", "profit exceeds expectations", "revenue deceleration with margin expansion")

### Initial Assessment
Based on the above metrics, provide a high-level assessment of the company's current state (e.g., strategic investment phase, profit harvesting period, growth bottleneck stage).

## Step 2: Detailed Breakdown & Attribution Analysis

### Revenue Decomposition
- **By Business Segment**: Break down revenue composition, growth rates, and contribution ratios by core business segments
- **By Revenue Type**: Analyze revenue by type (product revenue, service revenue, commissions, advertising, etc.)
- **Attribution Analysis**: Identify primary drivers of revenue growth/decline (volume, price, new business, M&A)

### Profit & Expense Analysis
- **Gross Margin Analysis**: Calculate gross margin and analyze changes (cost control, product mix, subsidy levels)
- **Operating Expense Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of sales, administrative, and R&D expenses (absolute amounts, expense ratios, YoY changes). Focus on items with largest changes and explain reasons
- **Operating Margin Analysis**: Combine gross margin and expense ratio analysis to explain operating margin changes

### Bottom Line Analysis
Analyze items between operating profit and net profit (investment income, interest, taxes, non-recurring items) and explain differences between net and operating profit.

## Step 3: Business Deep Dive

### Core Business (Cash Cow)
- Identify the company's core cash-generating businesses and their revenue/profit performance
- Assess core business health: Is growth rate and profitability stable, strengthening, or deteriorating? Why?

### New Business/Growth Engines
- Identify new businesses receiving significant investment and their financial performance
- Analyze investment intensity: Are losses expanding or contracting? How does management evaluate progress?

### Strategic Synergies
Analyze synergies between core and new businesses: Are core business profits supporting new business development? Do new businesses benefit core operations?

## Step 4: Financial Health & Cash Flow Assessment

### Balance Sheet Health
Brief assessment of cash & equivalents, short-term debt, long-term debt, shareholders' equity. Calculate debt-to-equity ratio.

### Cash Flow Analysis
- Analyze operating cash flow, investing activities (capital expenditure increases?), financing activities (borrowing or share buybacks?)
- **Focus on Free Cash Flow (FCF)** assessment and underlying drivers

### Key Ratios
Calculate operational efficiency metrics like inventory turnover days, accounts receivable turnover days (where applicable).

## Step 5: Comparative Analysis, Summary & Outlook

### Competitive Comparison
If clear competitors exist, compare key financial metrics.

## Output Requirements
